###  textbook

[introduction to data mining, by pang-ning tan, michael steinbach, anuj karpatne, vipin kumar, isbn: 0133128903, 2018](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~kumar001/dmbook/index.php)

###  description

data mining studies the algorithms and computational paradigms that allow computers to discover knowledge and perform decision automatically using large and complex datasets.  in this course, we will explain the fundamental principles, technical details, and real life applications of data mining techniques through lectures, case studies, and course projects.  the core topics to be covered include data preproprocessing, classification, cluster analysis, association analysis, anomaly detection, neural networks, model evaluation, and applications like recommernder systems.  

**learning goals**

1.  think sysematically of how data mining can solve analytical problems, to make better infromed decisions using various real-world data.

2.  understand data mining process, algorithm development, and system deign to build a pathway to the career of a data scientist.

###  outline

####  1.  introduction
-  why big data?  what is big data mining?  why data mining?  data mining processes, relation to budiness intelligence techniques
-  introduction to data mining tasks (classification, clustering, association analysis, anomaly detection).  what is a model?  basic terminologies, predictive modeling
-  real world data mining applications

####  2.  data and preproprocessing
-  understanding of data, what is data?  type of attributes, properties of attribute values, types of data, data quality
-  sampling, data normalization, data cleaning, similarity measures
-  feature selection / instance selection, the importance of feature selection / instance selectin in various big data scenarios 

####  3.  classification
-  decision-tree based approach (e.g. C4.5)
-  rule-based approach (e.g. Ripper)
-  instance based classifiers (e.g. k-nearest neighbor)
-  support vector machines (svms)
-  ensemble learning
